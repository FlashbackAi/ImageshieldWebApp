/**
 * The question screen, before the questions arrive.
 *
 * `QuizFlow` renders this while `GET /api/quiz-definition` is in flight. The
 * layout is the same screen's, measurement for measurement — the progress row's
 * 920px track, the 600px column under it, and option rows at the 53.7px the
 * design draws — so the words drop into boxes that are already where they will
 * stay. Both files have to move together; the reasoning behind each number is
 * in `QuizFlow` and `QuizProgress`, beside the real thing.
 *
 * The prompt is reserved at one line and the answers at five rows, which is
 * not an average — it is question one exactly. This only ever shows when the
 * definition is not already in the tab, and `useQuizDefinition` keeps it for
 * the tab's whole life, so what it stands in for is very nearly always the
 * first screen of a fresh visit: a one-line prompt over five options. Averaging
 * the six questions instead would trade an exact fit on the screen this
 * actually appears on for a near fit on five it does not.
 *
 * The progress bar is drawn empty rather than at some invented percentage. It
 * is the one element on the screen whose fill means something, and a bar
 * showing a third when the visitor is on question one would be a small lie
 * told in a loading state.
