/**
 * The shell the details and OTP screens share.
 *
 * Still the marketing site rather than the funnel proper — same reasoning as the
 * quiz intro, so this doesn't reach for `<Screen>` either: the site header stays,
 * the canvas stays full width, and only the column underneath is funnel-shaped.
 *
 * Measured off the 1920×1271 details export: a 560px column centred on the page,
 * its heading 179px below the 65px header, everything inside it flush left. The
 * design draws desktop only; the top gap collapses on smaller screens, where
 * 179px of nothing would push the first field off a phone.
