/**
 * The key printed under the gauge: three bands, each with its colour and its range.
 *
 * New in the LHS Results V1 export, and it replaces the "High Risk" / "Low Risk"
 * captions that used to sit inside the drawing under the 0 and 100 ticks. Moving it
 * out is what lets it name all three bands rather than only the two ends — and it
 * puts the ranges on the page, which is the thing that makes a bare 43 legible.
 *
 * Deliberately not a legend for the SCORE: nothing here is highlighted for the band
 * the visitor landed in. It is a scale, the same for everyone, which is why the arc
 * above it and the headline beside it are left to say where this person sits.
 *
 * A plain grid rather than a list, because the three rules have to sit on one line
 * across the gauge's width whatever the labels underneath do.
