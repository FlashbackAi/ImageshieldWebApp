/**
 * The arc at the top of the result screen.
 *
 * A fill, not a band highlight: it runs from 0 up to the score, cut at the 50 and 80
 * boundaries so each stretch can take its own gradient. The whole gauge picks one
 * colour set from the score's band. Both the geometry and the gradients are the
 * app's `ScoreGauge` — its `report` variant, whose angles (211.11° / 136.83° /
 * 45.83° / −28.70°, measured anticlockwise) are the same arc this screen's export
 * was drawn from.
 *
 * Drawn in a viewBox centred on the arc's own centre, so the geometry is just radii
 * and angles. The labels are part of the drawing rather than HTML around it, so the
 * whole thing scales as one piece instead of reflowing at small widths.
 */

/**
 * Scale labels, positioned as measured off the design rather than derived.
 *
 * The two middle ticks are pushed radially out of their gaps, but 0 and 100 are not
 * — they sit directly *under* the arc's tips, inside the outer radius. One formula
 * can't produce both, so these are points.
 *
 * Read off `result_gauge.svg`, which draws the gauge at 189.8px across a 331px
 * frame: each box's centre and baseline, less the arc's own centre, over that
 * scale. Worth knowing before "tidying" them — the four are NOT symmetric, and
 * deliberately so. 0 and 100 mirror each other on their OUTER edges (±113 units),
 * not their centres, so the three-digit 100 sits 10 units nearer the middle than
 * the single-digit 0 does. Centring them as a pair is what pushed 100 out far
 * enough to touch the arc's right tip.
 *
 * The "High Risk" / "Low Risk" captions that used to sit under 0 and 100 are gone:
 * the LHS Results V1 export moves that key out of the drawing and into the printed
 * scale below the whole gauge, where it can name all three bands and their ranges
 * rather than only the two ends. See `ScoreScale`.
