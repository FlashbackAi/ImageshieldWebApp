/**
 * "Benefits of the app" — the foot of the result screen.
 *
 * The score is already saved against the phone number the visitor just verified, so
 * there is no token to redeem and nothing to carry across: the handoff is "install
 * the app, sign in with that number". The store badges and the QR now sit further up
 * the page, in the two `DownloadPrompt` blocks — which is why this takes no `handoff`
 * any more: it is purely the pitch, with nothing in it addressed to one visitor.
 *
 * The feature list is a control, not a static list — the design's comment on the
 * mockup reads "This image can change based on the feature selected", so picking a
 * feature swaps the phone beside it. Built as a vertical tablist: four tabs, one
 * panel, which is what this is even though each tab keeps its own copy visible.
 *
 * The LHS Results V1 export draws these as four plain cards beside a fixed mockup,
 * with no selected state — but only ever produced the one app screen, so a static
 * version would be four cards pointing at the same picture. The tabs are kept and
 * restyled to the export's card, ready for the three screens that don't exist yet.
 *
 * Not `<DownloadSection>` from the landing page — that one is the black, centred
 * store-badge footer.
 *
 * The phone export stacks the three parts heading / mockup / cards rather than
 * putting the mockup in a column beside the cards, and that order is the reason the
 * markup below is three grid items rather than two columns: a phone reader meets
 * the screen the cards describe BEFORE the cards, so the first card has something to
 * change. Below `lg` the section is a column and `order` runs it; at `lg` the
 * explicit row/column placement takes over and restores the export's two columns.
