/**
 * The lavender card the export uses twice: "Your risk factors" and "Immediate
 * Recommendations".
 *
 * Both are the same object — a heading over a list of rows, each row an outlined
 * glyph in a white disc beside a title and a paragraph — so they are one component
 * taking different rows rather than two that have to be kept in step.
 *
 * The two differ in exactly one way, and it is deliberate: a risk factor's title is
 * a noun the eye can land on ("Age", "Gender"), so it is set large; a recommendation's
 * title is a whole instruction ("Sign up for YouTube's free likeness detection
 * service"), so it is set at body size in bold. Setting the sentence at the noun's
 * size would make the card read as three competing headlines. `emphasis` picks which.
 *
 * On a phone that distinction is dropped, because the export drops it: at 403px the
 * column is too narrow for a 20px noun to sit on one line beside an 84px disc, so
 * both cards set their titles at 15px bold and the whole card shrinks with them —
 * 59px discs, a 16px radius and a flat ground.
 *
 * That flat ground is the other phone-only change. The card's ground fades out over
 * its last 5% — the export's own gradient, which stops the block ending on a hard
 * edge against the white page — but a 24px fade eats the bottom corners of a 16px
 * radius, so below `sm` the fill is flat and the corners survive.
