/**
 * A block standing in for something that hasn't arrived yet.
 *
 * Everything it is — the ground, the travelling sheen, and the way it behaves
 * under `prefers-reduced-motion` — lives in the `.skeleton` rules in
 * `globals.css`. This is only the element, so a screen can reserve space in
 * Tailwind rather than reaching for the class name by hand and getting the
 * light/dark pair wrong on the one page with a black canvas.
 *
 * A `<span>` set to `block` rather than a `<div>`: several of these stand in
 * for lines of copy inside a `<p>`, and a `<div>` there is invalid markup the
 * browser silently reparents — which moves the placeholder out of the block it
 * is meant to be measuring.
 *
 * `aria-hidden` throughout. A skeleton is the absence of content, and the
 * screen that owns it is what says so: every one of them sits inside a region
 * marked `aria-busy`, so a reader hears "loading" once rather than a dozen
 * empty group boundaries.
 *
 * No `role="presentation"` and no width of its own — the caller sizes it,
 * because the whole point is reserving the box the real thing will occupy.
