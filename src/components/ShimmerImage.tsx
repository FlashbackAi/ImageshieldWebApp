/**
 * A `next/image` with a shimmering block behind it until the file has decoded.
 *
 * The site is photograph-heavy — the hero plate alone is 1.1MB, and the three
 * How It Works screenshots and the app mockup are a further half a megabyte —
 * and `next/image` reserves the box but paints nothing in it. On a fast
 * connection that is invisible; on a slow one the page arrives as its type with
 * rectangular holes where its pictures go, which reads as a broken page rather
 * than a loading one.
 *
 * BEHIND, not over, and that is the whole design of this component.
 *
 * The obvious way to write it is to hold the image at `opacity-0` and fade it
 * in when `onLoad` fires. Don't: that makes every picture on the site depend on
 * React hydrating. A bundle that fails to load, a browser that blocks it, a
 * device that is still parsing it — any of those and the hero is a permanently
 * invisible element with a placeholder sitting on top of it. It is the page's
 * LCP image; it cannot be the thing that JavaScript is allowed to lose.
 *
 * So the placeholder is laid under the picture and the picture is left alone.
 * An image element paints nothing until it has pixels, so the shimmer shows
 * through on its own, and the moment the picture decodes it covers it — no
 * state, no hydration, no fade to mistime. `onLoad` then unmounts the
 * placeholder, which is only about stopping an animation nobody can see; if it
 * never fires, the page still looks exactly right.
 *
 * That ordering is load-bearing in the markup below. Both elements are
 * positioned with an automatic z-index, so which one is on top is decided by
 * which comes second — the placeholder is rendered FIRST in both branches.
 *
 * `onLoad` fires for a cached image too, so returning to a page does not leave
 * a placeholder animating behind a picture the browser already had:
 * `next/image` checks `img.complete` in a layout effect and calls the handler
 * itself.
