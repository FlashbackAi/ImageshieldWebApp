/**
 * Social links and trust markers — the foot of the page.
 *
 * Concept 1 draws nothing below How It Works, and it has already said everything
 * this section used to: the five stars, the line about families protected and both
 * store badges are in the hero card now. What is left is the part of the old strip
 * the new design has no place for and the page would be poorer without, kept on
 * the black it has always been on.
 *
 * `#download` still resolves here, which is where the nav's Download app button
 * points on a phone — the hero's own badges are above the fold on desktop, but a
 * visitor who has scrolled to the bottom should not have to scroll back.
