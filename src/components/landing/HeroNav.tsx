/**
 * Concept 1's bar, over the landing hero only.
 *
 * Measured off the 1440-wide design: a full-bleed 96px row with a 1px `ink-soft`
 * rule under it, the logo 40px in from the left at its native 178×40, the five
 * links set 16px in `ink-onnight` with 35px between them, then the two pills the
 * bar ends with — a 212×50 outline and a 154×48 solid white — 24px apart, the
 * second ending 53px from the right edge.
 *
 * The bar has no fill of its own. It is a 10px backdrop blur and nothing else, so
 * what shows through it is the top of the photograph behind — which at that height
 * is near enough black that the rule, not a panel edge, is what separates the two.
 * That only works over a photograph: every funnel screen is a near-white canvas,
 * where white on clear glass is unreadable, so those keep the solid V1 bar.
 *
 * The insets are held against the viewport rather than a centred 1440 container.
 * Capping them there would turn the bar into a centred strip with gutters on a
 * wider monitor and pull the logo away from the headline underneath it, which
 * `HeroSection` also holds against the viewport for the same reason.
 *
 * Logo, five 16px links and the two pills need 1149px of the 1440 the design gives
 * them, so the run collapses behind a disclosure under `xl` rather than `lg`: at
 * 1024 the links overlap the wordmark and "How It Works" breaks onto two lines. The
 * bar takes its full 96px height at the same breakpoint, so the 305px the hero
 * below it holds to the headline is measured from the same place the design does. The pills go into the
 * disclosure with them rather than staying in the row: they are the two most
 * important destinations on the page, and shrinking them to fit beside a hamburger
 * is what would make them look optional.
