/**
 * The quiz pitch, on the one coral card the site has.
 *
 * Off the 1440 frame: a 1379×523 card with a 24px radius, inset 35px from either
 * edge with 26px of white above and below it, 75px of padding in from its own left
 * edge. Inside, two columns — the ask on the left, the three numbers that justify
 * it on the right, the second starting at x 970, which is what the `1fr / 270px`
 * split with a 99px gutter resolves to at the design width.
 *
 * The heading is ExtraBold tracked -1.5px, which at its 48px is the -0.03125em
 * set here — an em rather than the design's px so the 32px phone size is tracked
 * by the same proportion rather than three times as hard.
 *
 * The numbers column is 361px, not the 369 the export measures. The export draws
 * the card at x 35 width 1379 in a 1440 frame — 35px of white on its left and 26 on
 * its right — which is a slip, not a lean, so the card here is symmetric and ends
 * 9px earlier. Taking those 9px off the column instead puts every figure and every
 * line under it back on the x the design sets, which is the half that shows.
 *
 * The card stops growing at the 1370 the design gives it. Past that the band goes
 * on bleeding and the card centres inside it: left to fill a 1920 monitor, the
 * `1fr` column would open a 700px hole between the ask and the numbers that are
 * supposed to be answering it.
 *
 * The two columns do not share a top edge: the left one starts 117px down and the
 * right one 96px, so they are separate blocks with their own padding rather than
 * rows of one grid. Stacked under `lg` that difference disappears, which is the
 * right answer there — a figure and the sentence it belongs to read as one block.

                not by `vertical-align` — `sup` arrives carrying the UA sheet's

                Bold: the words around them are ExtraBold, and a mark set at the
