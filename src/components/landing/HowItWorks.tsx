/**
 * The three steps, each under a screen from the app it is describing.
 *
 * Off the 1440 frame: three 190×318 phone frames on 357px centres — a 1072-wide
 * column centred on the page — outlined 4px in `navbar` at 30%, with the step
 * number set 48px in the same purple at 20% under each.
 *
 * The rule between two frames is drawn from inside the left-hand phone: it starts
 * 127px in from that frame's left edge, on its vertical centre, and fades out to
 * nothing 15px inside the next one. So it belongs to the phone it leaves, not to
 * the gap — which is also what makes the paint order right without any z-index:
 * each rule sits over its own screenshot and under the next phone, because that is
 * the order the three list items are already in.
 *
 * The screenshots are 552×980 against a 184×312 opening, so they are set to cover
 * and left centred. Centred is the export's own answer, not a default fallen back
 * on: each pattern scales its shot to fill the width and then translates it up by
 * 7.3, 8.4 and 8.2px against overflows of 14.6, 16.7 and 16.5 — 50.0% in all three
 * cases. Pinning them to the top instead shows 8px more of each status bar and
 * eats 8px more of each tab bar.
 *
 * Under `lg` the three stack and the rules go, since a rule that fades to the right
 * says nothing about a step that is now underneath.
