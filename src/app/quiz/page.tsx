/**
 * Quiz intro — where "Take the Quiz" lands.
 *
 * Still the marketing site rather than the funnel proper: it keeps the site header
 * and the full-width canvas, and only the column underneath is funnel-shaped. So
 * this screen builds its own shell instead of reaching for `<Screen>`, which is
 * phone-first and caps at 30rem.
 *
 * Measured off the 1920×1280 design: a 536px column centred on the page, sitting
 * 199px below the 65px header, everything inside it flush left. That puts the badge
 * at y=264, the heading's cap line at 398, and the button at 612 — the export's own
 * numbers, which the column reproduces to the pixel at `lg` and up.
