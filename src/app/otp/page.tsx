/**
 * Phone verification.
 *
 * The design set doesn't include this screen, so it borrows the details screen's
 * shell verbatim — same header, same 560px column, same heading and button sizes —
 * and takes its behaviour from the app's OTPScreen, which is the version of this
 * step users of the product already know.
 *
 * The 15 minutes in the subtitle is the funnel's own pending window, which is a limit
 * this side genuinely enforces — the API's challenge carries its own `expires_at`, and
 * quoting a number we don't control would be a promise we can't keep. Whichever runs
 * out first, the screen's dead end is the same and it offers a fresh number.
 *
 * No guard here, and it is not because there is nothing to guard: the quiz IS
 * answered by this point. `OtpForm` bounces a visitor with no phone in the store back
 * to the details form, and that form is what checks the quiz — so nobody reaches this
 * screen without both. Nothing this page could add on the server would help anyway,
 * since the answers live in the tab and have never been sent.
