/**
 * What stands in for the result screen while the server fetches the score.
 *
 * `/score` renders on the server off the session cookie, and reading the score
 * means a round trip to the API before a single byte of the page can be sent.
 * Without this the browser sits on the previous screen for the whole of that
 * trip — on a slow connection, several seconds in which tapping the button did
 * nothing visible. Next wraps the page in a Suspense boundary for us and
 * streams this immediately in its place.
 *
 * Laid out against `ScoreResult`, block for block and gap for gap, because a
 * skeleton whose shape is a guess is worse than none: the real screen then
 * lands with everything a few dozen pixels off where the eye had already put
 * it. The two files have to be changed together — the comments there carry the
 * reasoning behind every measurement repeated here.
 *
 * One state this cannot help: a visitor with no session at all is redirected to
 * `/details`, and a redirect decided on the server arrives after this has
 * already painted, so they see a beat of skeleton on the way past. That is the
 * price of streaming, and it is worth paying — the visitors who DO have a score
 * are the ones this page is for, and they are the ones waiting on the API.
 *
 * `SiteHeader` is the real one, not a placeholder. It needs no data, and a bar
 * that is already the right purple with the logo in it is the difference
 * between a page loading and a page missing.
