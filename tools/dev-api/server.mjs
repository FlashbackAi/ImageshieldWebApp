/**
 * A stand-in for the ImageShield /v1 API, for developing the funnel without it.
 *
 * NOT part of the app and never imported by it — nothing under src/ may reference
 * this directory. It exists so the funnel can be walked end to end without the real
 * API: offline, against a branch, or into the states a real backend will not produce
 * on demand — a score that isn't ready, a write that fails once, an access token about
 * to expire.
 *
 *   npm run dev:api       this alone, on port 5099
 *   npm run dev:offline   this plus `next dev` pointed at it
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FAITHFUL ABOUT, because these are what the funnel's code paths turn on:
 *
 *   - Every failure is the `{ error, message }` envelope, with the codes the real
 *     API uses. Branch on `error`, never on `message`.
 *   - An unknown OTP challenge is 404 NOT_FOUND, not 401. Verified against the live
 *     API, and contradicting the Postman collection, which documents 401.
 *   - Refresh tokens ROTATE. Presenting a spent one is 401.
 *   - `PATCH /v1/me/profile` rejects unknown fields with a 400 rather than ignoring
 *     them, and builds its update from the keys actually present.
 *   - `POST /v1/me/email` is 202 and leaves the address unverified.
 *   - `GET /v1/me/score` 404s with NO_QUIZ_RESPONSE before the quiz. It is the one
 *     read allowed to 404 on emptiness.
 *   - `POST /v1/quiz/responses` validates the version, the answer keys AND the
 *     answer values against the served definition.
 *   - `resend_after` is an ISO instant, not a number of seconds.
 *   - A question may carry `required: false`, and `platforms` does.
 *   - No route accepts an identifier saying whose data to touch. The bearer token
 *     is the only answer to that question.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT: a scorer. The score is a fixed fixture with a plausible breakdown;
 * it does not vary with the answers. Nothing about how the funnel renders a score
 * depends on the number being derived, and inventing a second scoring implementation
 * is precisely the mistake the real API's docs warn about.

     the quiz before the phone number, so there was no token to read them with. The
     endpoint is public now, so the copy is gone and both ends read this: the screens
     once at the start, `/api/quiz` again at submit.

     The submit-time re-read is still the drift check, and it still reproduces locally
     — but the way to trigger it has changed. Editing quiz.json no longer diverges from
     anything, because nothing local is being compared against; edit it WHILE a tab is
     mid-quiz and that tab's answers meet a definition that has moved, which is the
     real-world case (a deploy mid-funnel) the 409 retake path exists for.

     Built field by field rather than by stripping `_readme`, so what the fixture
