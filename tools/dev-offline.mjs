/**
 * `next dev` and the /v1 fixture, as one command that cleans up after itself.
 *
 * A shell one-liner (`fixture & next dev`) very nearly works, and its failure mode is
 * the annoying kind: whether Ctrl-C reaches the backgrounded fixture depends on
 * process-group behaviour that differs between shells and between interactive and
 * non-interactive runs. When it doesn't, the fixture is orphaned holding port 5099
 * and the NEXT run of this command silently talks to a stale server. Supervising both
 * from Node makes shutdown explicit instead of incidental.
 *
 * Not a production concern in any way — this file is only ever run by `npm run
 * dev:offline`.
